# Development Journals

## 📔 Purpose
These journals are the **memory and context bridge** between Claude Code sessions. Since context can be cleared between sessions, these journals contain all critical information needed to continue the project.

## 📖 Reading Protocol
**BEFORE STARTING ANY WORK:**
1. Read the most recent 2 journal entries
2. If this is your first session, read ALL entries
3. Pay special attention to:
   - Configuration commands that worked
   - File paths and dependencies
   - Problems encountered and solutions
   - Current phase status

## ✍️ Writing Protocol
**AT THE END OF EACH PHASE:**
1. Create a new journal entry
2. Name it: `[YYYY-MM-DD]_phase[XX]_[description].md`
3. Include ALL critical information for context handoff
4. Assume the next session starts with zero knowledge except these journals

## 🎯 Remember
These journals are your lifeline across sessions. Without them, you lose all context. With them, you can pick up exactly where you left off.

**Every phase MUST end with a journal entry!**
