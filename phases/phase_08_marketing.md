## 💻 Code Requirements

### 1. Marketing Team Configuration (`src/configs/marketing_team.yaml`)
```yaml
team:
  name: "marketing_team"
  lead: "content_strategist"
  
  agents:
    content_strategist:
      role: "Plan and coordinate content"
      responsibilities: ["content_calendar", "campaign_planning"]
    
    content_writer:
      role: "Generate content"
      styles: ["professional", "casual", "technical"]
    
    editor:
      role: "Review and refine content"
      checks: ["grammar", "tone", "brand_alignment"]
    
    social_manager:
      role: "Schedule and post content"
      platforms: ["twitter", "linkedin", "blog"]
  
  workflow:
    pipeline: "strategist -> writer -> editor -> manager"
    approval_required: true
```

### 2. Content Pipeline (`src/agents/content_pipeline.py`)
```python
class ContentPipeline:
    def __init__(self, config_path):
        self.config = self.load_config(config_path)
        self.strategist = ContentStrategist()
        self.writer = ContentWriter()
        self.editor = Editor()
        self.manager = SocialManager()
        
    def create_campaign(self, topic: str, goals: List[str]) -> Dict:
        """Create complete marketing campaign"""
        # Plan content
        plan = self.strategist.create_plan(topic, goals)
        
        # Generate content
        content_pieces = []
        for item in plan.content_items:
            # Write
            draft = self.writer.generate(item)
            
            # Edit
            edited = self.editor.review(draft)
            
            # Schedule
            scheduled = self.manager.schedule(edited)
            content_pieces.append(scheduled)
        
        return {
            "campaign": plan.campaign_name,
            "content": content_pieces,
            "schedule": self.manager.get_calendar()
        }
```

### 3. Content Writer (`src/agents/content_writer.py`)
```python
class ContentWriter:
    def generate(self, brief: Dict) -> str:
        """Generate content from brief"""
        content_type = brief["type"]
        
        if content_type == "tweet":
            return self.write_tweet(brief)
        elif content_type == "blog":
            return self.write_blog(brief)
        elif content_type == "linkedin":
            return self.write_linkedin(brief)
    
    def write_tweet(self, brief: Dict) -> str:
        """Generate tweet with hashtags"""
        content = self.generate_short_content(brief["message"])
        hashtags = self.generate_hashtags(brief["topic"])
        return f"{content}\n\n{' '.join(hashtags)}"
```

## 🧪 Testing Regime

### Test Scenario 1: Content Generation
```python
def test_content_generation():
    """Test content creation quality"""
    brief = {"type": "tweet", "topic": "AI development", "tone": "professional"}
    content = writer.generate(brief)
    assert len(content) <= 280
    assert "#" in content
```

### Test Scenario 2: Editing Quality
```python
def test_editing_process():
    """Test editor improvements"""
    draft = "This is a bad written content"
    edited = editor.review(draft)
    assert "badly written" in edited or "poorly written" in edited
```

### Test Scenario 3: Pipeline Flow
```python
def test_complete_pipeline():
    """Test end-to-end content pipeline"""
    campaign = pipeline.create_campaign("Product Launch", ["awareness", "engagement"])
    assert len(campaign["content"]) > 0
    assert campaign["schedule"]
```
