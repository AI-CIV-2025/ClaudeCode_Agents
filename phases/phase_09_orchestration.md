        self.config = self.load_config(config_path)
        self.teams = self.initialize_teams()
        self.projects = []
        
    def process_request(self, request: str) -> Dict:
        """Process high-level request"""
        # Analyze request
        analysis = self.analyze_request(request)
        
        # Create project plan
        project = self.create_project(analysis)
        
        # Allocate to teams
        allocations = self.allocate_work(project)
        
        # Execute with monitoring
        results = self.execute_project(allocations)
        
        # Synthesize results
        return self.synthesize_results(results)
    
    def allocate_work(self, project: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Allocate work to appropriate teams"""
        allocations = {}
        
        for task in project.tasks:
            team = self.determine_team(task)
            if team not in allocations:
                allocations[team] = []
            allocations[team].append(task)

    allocations = chief.get_current_allocations()
    assert allocations["development"]["urgent"] > allocations["development"]["normal"]
```

### Test Scenario 3: System Integration
```python
def test_full_system_integration():
    """Test complete system working together"""
    # Complex request
    result = chief.process_request(
        "Research crypto market, develop trading bot, create marketing campaign"
    )
    
    # Verify all teams contributed
    assert result["research"]["analysis_complete"]
    assert result["development"]["bot_functional"]
    assert result["marketing"]["campaign_ready"]
```

## üìî PHASE COMPLETION REQUIREMENT

**YOU MUST WRITE A DEV JOURNAL ENTRY BEFORE ENDING THIS PHASE**

Critical items to document:
- Working configurations and setup commands
- Integration points with previous phases
- Test results and what's verified working
- Any challenges solved and solutions
- Clear next steps for the next phase

Save to: `/docs/dev_journals/[date]_phaseXX_complete.md`

After writing, you can clear context knowing the next session will have everything needed.
